Support may require the Easy Smart Switch hardware versions and latest firmware.

## Installation
1. **Install the App**: Search for "TP-Link Managed Switch" in the Homey app store and install it.
2. **Add a Device**: After installing, go to the Homey app and selecting the "TP-Link Managed Switch" app from the devices list.
3. **Configure Settings**: Enter the IP address, username, and password for your TP-Link managed switch to allow Homey to communicate with it.

## Usage

### Enabling/Disabling Ports
1. **Manual Control**:
   - Open the Homey app.
   - Select your TP-Link switch from the devices list.
   - Use the provided controls to enable or disable specific ports on the switch.

2. **Automated Control with Flows**:
   - Create a new flow in Homey.
   - Choose a trigger (e.g., time, device state).
   - Add an action to enable or disable a specific port on your TP-Link switch.
   - Save and activate the flow.

### Example Flows
- **Disable Guest Network at Night**: Automatically disable ports connected to guest network devices at night.
- **Enable Office Network During Working Hours**: Set up a flow to enable office network ports only during working hours.

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure that your TP-Link managed switch is on the same network as your Homey and that the IP address, username, and password are correctly entered. If you are using an IP address, make sure your switch is configured to have a static IP address.
- **Port Control Not Working**: Verify that the switch model is supported and that the firmware is up to date.

## Known Issues
- **UI Session Logout**: The TP-Link managed switch hardware allows at most one active session. When the Homey app's connects to the switch any active sessions are logged out. This will occur on demand based on flow actions and also periodically in the background (hourly).
